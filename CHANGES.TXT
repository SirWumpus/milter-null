--TODO--

--0.7--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.8

   !	Configure and build changes to reflect changes in libsnert.

--0.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.68.968

   !	The time_t type can be signed or unsigend 32 or 64-bits long.
	Newer systems appear to be moving towards signed 64-bit. This
	can cause problems when trying to compare X-Null-Tag strings
	generated by a system using a time_t with a different size.

	To resolve this, milter-null now uses the ASCII encoded 62-year
	cycle of the timestamp. For our purposes that is more than
	sufficient resolution and portable.

	This change will invalidate all previously X-Null-Tag headers
	generated by the system with the previous version. During the
	next date-ttl seconds, it is recommended to set policy=none to
	avoid rejecting any useful DSN/MDN. The alternative is to just
	let the milter reject possibly valid DSN/MDN carrying the older
	X-Null-Tag version.

   !	sample.mc.in: Removed from define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl

--0.5--


--0.4--

   !	Fixed possible off by one error for body chunks less than 20
   	bytes. Reported by Ben Lentz.

   !	Fixed bug where a DSN Date: header would prevent the original
   	message's Date: header supplied in the DSN message body from
   	being found and thus bounce valid DSN messages. Reported by
   	Jim Hermann.

--0.3--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63

   !	If {msg_id} is undefined and no Message-ID: header was found
	then the message_id[0] defaulted to '0' instead of the nul
	byte '\0'. This could cause the milter to crash.

   +	Added quarantine to the list of possible policies.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   !	Rejection based on access-db blacklisting now disabled. Some
	users prefer leaving blacklisting upto Sendmail and not the
	milter. Reported by Derek Balling and others.

  !!	filterBody(): Fixed obsecure bug when the message content is
	less than 20 bytes long, adding a terminating NUL to the body
	chunk for the trace log output actually overwrote off the end
	of a dynamic buffer on some Linux systems causing the milter
	to crash. Reported by Martin Lathoud.

--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.62

   +	Postfix 2.3 does not support the sendmail {msg_id} macro, so
   	use the Message-ID: header found by filterHeader() when {msg-id}
   	is NULL.

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61
